# Exploring What's Out There

## Overview of Project

We wanted to extend the ability for users to search our UFO sighting tables more specifically. Those specifics: city, state, country, and shape of sighting. The new filter table allows for the freeform searching of any or all of the parameters.

## Overview of the Results

Your new search table is now going to let your users find more specific sightings around them either by location or type of sighting. Previously, we were only able to search by date

Now, users can search by any and all criteria they want. In this example, date and city.

## Future Notes

With this new setting, we now offer a variety of ways for people to search or table. However, we are requiring them to give exactly the correct information that the table was created with. Meaning if they put in a shape that is close to or not in the table, they will get nothing in the table. What I recommend we do is make a dropdown for that selection so that users can pick the shape they want without having to be perfect. Secondly, I would recommend that we make drop downs of available countries for the exact same reason as above.
